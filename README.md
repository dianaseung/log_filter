### Usage: Steps
1. place the log file you'd like to filter in the same folder as the script as *liferay.log*
2. run the python script
```python unique_errors.py```
or 
```python3 unique_errors.py```
3. open the resulting *unique_errors.txt* file in the same directory

### Upcoming Planned Features:
1. Be able to include WARN
2. be able to filter any *.log file
3. unique output files so that they don't override previous outputs
